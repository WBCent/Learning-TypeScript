"use strict";
let username = "Will";
console.log(username);
// let a = 12;
// let b = '6';
// let c = 2;
// console.log(a/b); //error here as b is a string and a is not. Even though this works with JS and shows up in the Live server console it is wrong and it could be better.
// to fix this:
let a = 12;
let b = 6;
let c = 2;
//remember to set noEmitOnError to true so that when the compiler doesn't like something it doesn't still put the error out.
console.log(c * b);
